                One Direction, British-Irish male vocal group whose stylish good looks and bright pop-rock sound captivated young fans
                around the world in the early 2010s. The members were Niall Horan (b. September 13, 1993, Mullingar, County Westmeath,
                Ireland), Zayn Malik (b. January 12, 1993, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England), Liam Payne (b. August 29, 1993,
                Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England), Harry Styles (b. February 1, 1994, Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England), and Louis
                Tomlinson (b. December 24, 1991, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England).
                The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent contest for aspiring singers. Each of the
                five members auditioned and originally competed as a solo performer, but early in the season they were advised to pool
                their talents. Taking the name One Direction, the boys—all were between 16 and 18 years old at the time—attracted
                substantial attention, especially from young female viewers, for their charismatic stage presence and vocal skills.
                Although One Direction ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show’s mastermind, Simon Cowell, offered
                the act a recording contract soon after the season ended.

                In the tradition of earlier pop-music “boy bands,” One Direction was promoted as a set of teen idols who were musically
                compatible but also distinct in style and personality. After building its fan base in early 2011 by touring the British
                Isles with fellow The X Factor contestants, the group entered the recording studio. The resulting album, Up All Night
                (2011), filled with cheerily harmonized pop songs about carefree revelry, first-time heartbreak, and other adolescent
                concerns, was an immediate hit both at home and in other European and Commonwealth countries. Its popularity was fueled
                in part by the song “What Makes You Beautiful,” a buoyant empowerment anthem that topped the British and Irish singles
                charts and in early 2012 was named best British single at the Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammy Awards).
                Although the American market had often bedeviled otherwise popular British boy bands, One Direction, aided by a social
                media campaign that introduced the group to potential overseas fans, had little difficulty breaking through. Up All
                Night debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart upon its 2012 release and went on to sell more than a million
                copies in the United States. The quintet extended its worldwide success with its sophomore release, Take Me Home (2012),
                which departed little from the winning formula of its predecessor. In 2013 the group was the subject of a 3-D
                concert-tour documentary, One Direction: This Is Us, and released a third hit album, Midnight Memories. Two years later,
                while touring in support of the album Four (2014), One Direction announced that Malik had left the group. The remaining
                four continued to tour but announced a planned hiatus shortly before the release of Made in the A.M. (2015), and the
                band members began issuing solo albums thereafter.
